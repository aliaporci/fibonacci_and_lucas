# fibonacci_and_lucas

Verified using sequences from the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences](https://oeis.org), specifically:

[Decimal expansion of golden ratio phi (or tau) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2](https://oeis.org/A001622)

[F(F(n)), where F is a Fibonacci number](https://oeis.org/A007570)

[L(L(n)), where L(n) are Lucas numbers](https://oeis.org/A005371)

There is a slight but noticeable slowdown that starts around n = 30 on my MacBook Air.  
At n = 40, you have time to go pour and dress a cup of coffee.

If anyone knows of a more efficient way (memory/performance) to handle this, I'm curious to hear it.
